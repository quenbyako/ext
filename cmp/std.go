// Ordered is a constraint that permits any ordered type: any type
// that supports the operators < <= >= >.
// If future releases of Go add new ordered types,
// this constraint will be modified to include them.
//
// Note that floating-point types may contain NaN ("not-a-number") values.
// An operator such as == or < will always report false when
// comparing a NaN value with any other value, NaN or not.
// See the [Compare] function for a consistent way to compare NaN values.

// Less reports whether x is less than y.
// For floating-point types, a NaN is considered less than any non-NaN,
// and -0.0 is not less than (is equal to) 0.0.

// Compare returns
//
//	-1 if x is less than y,
//	 0 if x equals y,
//	+1 if x is greater than y.
//
// For floating-point types, a NaN is considered less than any non-NaN,
// a NaN is considered equal to a NaN, and -0.0 is equal to 0.0.
